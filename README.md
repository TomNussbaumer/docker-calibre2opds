# docker-calibre2opds

## Summary

This demo shows how to use [calibre2opds](http://calibre2opds.com/) with [Docker](http://www.docker.com).

related github repositories:

1. [calibre2opds sources](https://github.com/calibre2opds/calibre2opds)
2. [docker friendly ubuntu baseimage](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker) 

## Motivation

same as: [Motivation for docker-cops](https://github.com/TomNussbaumer/docker-cops/blob/master/README.md)

... but this time around using a static website approach. Additionally I want to play around with [the phusion baseimage](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker), which looks like it fixes the standard ubuntu problems when running within docker.

## Details

... will be filled later ...
